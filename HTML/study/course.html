                <br>
                <p>With advances in technology and cloud computing, there are now numerous data sources available to guide decision-making and drive organizational success. Harvesting the right kind of data requires that HR teams possess strong analytical skills; high-performing HR teams know that their function is to leverage data as a “decision science” by identifying metrics and data sources that deliver organizational insights. In order to do so, HR must ensure that metrics and measures are used effectively to achieve strategic goals. This course focuses on identifying effective data sources, developing meaningful metrics, designing long-term measures, and applying results in support of organizational strategy and tactics.</p>

                    <br>
                    <p>Embedded Software and Hardware Architecture is a first dive into understanding embedded architectures and writing software to manipulate this hardware. You will gain experience writing low-level firmware to directly interface hardware with highly efficient, readable and portable design practices. We will now transition from the Host Linux Machine where we built and ran code in a simulated environment to an Integrated Development Environment where you will build and install code directly on your ARM Cortex-M4 Microcontroller. Course assignments include writing firmware to interact and configure both the underlying ARM architecture and the MSP432 microcontroller platform. The course concludes with a project where you will develop a circular buffer data structure. <br>

                        In this course you will need the Texas Instruments LaunchPad with the MSP432 microcontroller in order to complete the assignments. Later courses of the Specialization will continue to use this hardware tool to develop even more exciting firmware.</p>

                            <br>
                            <p>If you are curious to learn more about the field of software engineering, this course is for you. No prior knowledge or qualification in programming or software development is necessary. Software Engineers are in great demand and now is a great time to learn more about this exciting career path.  

                                The field of software engineering is growing at an estimated rate of 22% according to the US Bureau of Labor and Statistics. In addition to aspiring software engineers, this course is also suitable for those in related careers such as Product and Project Managers, IT Managers, Information Developers and others who communicate and interact with software engineers. 
                                
                                This course teaches you about the power of the Software Development Lifecycle (SDLC) and software development methodologies like Agile. Explore fundamental programming principles and foundations of design, architecture, and deployment. Investigate skills a software engineer needs and identify job opportunities with hands-on projects. You will also learn about programming basics and software development tools and stacks. </p>

                                <br>
                                <p>In the first course of the Computer Vision for Engineering and Science specialization, you’ll be introduced to computer vision. You'll learn and use the most common algorithms for feature detection, extraction, and matching to align satellite images and stitch images together to create a single image of a larger scene. 

                                    Features are used in applications like motion estimation, object tracking, and machine learning. You’ll use features to estimate geometric transformations between images and perform image registration. Registration is important whenever you need to compare images of the same scene taken at different times or combine images acquired from different scientific instruments, as is common with hyperspectral and medical images.
                                    
                                    You will use MATLAB throughout this course.  MATLAB is the go-to choice for millions of people working in engineering and science, and provides the capabilities you need to accomplish your computer vision tasks.  You will be provided free access to MATLAB for the course duration to complete your work.
                                    
                                    To be successful in this course, it will help to have some prior image processing experience.  If you are new to image data, it’s recommended to first complete the Image Processing for Engineering and Science specialization.</p>

                                    <br>
                                    <p>Continuous process improvement is defined as, “The ongoing improvement of products, services or processes through incremental and breakthrough improvements.”

                                        It doesn’t only mean that a business should make changes along the way when things aren’t working smoothly. Instead, continuous process improvement is an actual type of work style that is designed to continuously review results and rapidly adopt new measures when deemed necessary. 
                                        
                                        Failure Mode & Effects Analysis (FMEA) is a systematic method for identifying, analysing, prioritising and documenting potential failure modes, determining their effects on system, product and process performance, and identifying corrective actions to eliminate failure modes or minimize the effect of failure. FMEA is an important Six Sigma, Lean Six Sigma and Continuous Improvement tool.
                                        
                                        This course will teach you the fundamental of FMEA for continuous process improvement.</p>
